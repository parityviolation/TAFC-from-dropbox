%            - CM is a good predictor of behavior (SHOW DECODING)

 %  CANNOT SEE a SIG difference in the x,y or speed ACROSS sessions.
 %  ALTHOUGH on individual sessions there is clearly something difference.
 %  WHY CAN'T I SEE it ACROSS sessions (variablity in behavior or
 %  measuremeint?) 
 % I NEED to BE ABLE TO SAY. 
 % 1) I CAN SEE choice differences by movement. BUT CAN'T SEE STIMULATION
 % MOVEMENT EFFET
 % 2) I CANNOT SEE choice differences in movement... So not surprising that
 % there is no effect of stimulation.

 % ARUGMENT expanded.
 %    CASE 1: use average videos (ignoring the technical issues)
 %            BUT average videos aren't really good unless there is
 %            something obvious ans systematic. BUT BUT.. just accept it is
 %            good enough? 
 %            Perhaps? THE STRONGEST case for this being true is if I
 %            CAN SEE MOVEMENT DIFFERENCE: i.e. In control Error Short
 %            Choice The animal is at Dx relative to Correct Long. So, I
 %            argue that I have the sensitivity in the measurement to
 %            resolve Choices in the movement. The  (and here comes the jump
 %            in logic) fact that there is is no difference in Stimulated from unstimulated
 %            indicates that the Observed Bias Short cannot be account for
 %            by movement. (Caveats 1) the effect on movement is too small
 %            to resolve (Response) Unlikely because the Choice bias is so
 %            strong.
